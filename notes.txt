General
-------
In several instances, the dynamics are only written for one of two of an instrument. These dynamics are assumed to apply to both parts.
28: "meno p" is written below the system (bass is not playing), presumably for Violin II which has the melody
33: "doux et grazieuz [sic]" above Violin I presumably also applies to Violin II and Viola

Flutes
------
17: The crescendo presumably applies to both parts
14: Flute 2 is presumably also f
34: *** Need to add duplicate (p)
